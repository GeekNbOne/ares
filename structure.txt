Goal of the library

To be a multi-asset risk system that can perform basic metrics computation, stress testing and scenario analysis.

The concept is to have securities that will have engines, that are the specific to each financial asset. The engine will
feed on risk factors, risk parameters.


The difference between risk factors and risk parameters is that risk factors are observable values and risk parameters are
computed.  Both of them shall be actionable.

When you add a security to a portfolio, it will add all risk factors and risk parameters to the stress testing pool
of the portfolio and this pool shall be accessible through the portfolio.

The risk factors are time series of different type:

- Single quote
- Term structure quote
- Surface quote

You should be able to compute correlation matrix or supply correlation matrix.

The risk factor will have their present state and on top of that their will be shock that will be apply.  You can call
basic present value or called shock present value.

Should I create a shock object that will define the shock ?
